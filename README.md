# Backend Service Platform

This project is a comprehensive backend service platform designed to manage user and journal entry data efficiently and securely. It leverages TypeScript for robust, type-safe backend development, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

## Features

- **User Management**: Supports user registration, authentication (JWT/session-based), and profile management.
- **Journal Entry Management**: Enables CRUD operations on journal entries and supports categorization for better organization.
- **Data Summary**: Offers endpoints for fetching summary data, allowing users to analyze their journaling habits.
- **Security**: Ensures all endpoints are secure and accessible only by authenticated users to protect data and privacy.
